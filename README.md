By the present fold you can find three sub folds in which you will find the data
and code (as jupyter notebook '.ipynb') used to run PLGM, PGRNN and RNN models.
________________________________________________________________________________

## Each '.ipynb' is composed by:
    - Needed packages to run the code
    -(**) Sub sections that corresponding to
       A.- modeling process (PLGM, RNN, PGRNN): 
            °Importing data
            °Needed functions
            °Model optimization
            °Optimized model ouput
            °Sensitivity analysis   
            
       B.- Visualization:
           ° Results visualization as plot and tables

## To run each sub-fold code you just need to run in order each cell inside in the corresponding section (**)
